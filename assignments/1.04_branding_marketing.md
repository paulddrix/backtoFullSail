# Overview

- Description of application
  - During this class, you will be creating a quiz app. Users will be able to create their own quizzes with multiple choice answers and then share those quizzes with others.
  - Examples of apps that work similarly are [Trivia Crack](http://www.triviacrack.com/) or [Quiz Up](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quizup/id718421443?mt=8)
- Pick a Subject Matter:
  - Think about what kind of app you would like to build.
  - Examples: general trivia, study prep, music trivia, movie trivia, friendship tests, code knowledge, etc (get creative!).
- Pick an Audience:
  - Now that you have a subject matter, what does the target demographic look like for your app?
  - What do you think the age, gender, education level?
  - Do some research to support your answer.

# Instructions

2. Update the README.md on master branch to your information
3. Switch to "gh-pages" Branch
   1. This branch is going to act as your brand guide and be a static site that your team can look at to see the brand of your application. In the future, you could add other documentation here.
   1. Follow instructions in the README.md to setup your gh-pages site.
   1. Change the content of the different *html* pages and *css* files to reflect the brand you have chosen.
   1. Put the subject matter and audience information that you have selected above in the brand/index.html page.

   1. Setup your root project *(similar to your asl_lecture project)*
   2. Setup your web server *(this should look like the web folder in the demo*)
